						I am a recent graduate with a strong passion for
						technology and a keen interest in web development and
						fullstack projects. While I may not have formal
						professional experience, I have spent over five years
						honing my skills in various aspects of technology,
						including web development, programming, and software
						engineering. One of my notable achievements is the
						development of an Android application in Java and
						SQLite. This application assists small businesses in
						managing worker attendance and calculating wages. This
						project showcases my proficiency in mobile app
						development and database management. In addition to
						hands-on projects, I have actively engaged in online
						courses and tutorials, staying up-to-date with the
						latest technologies and trends in the tech industry. My
						dedication to continuous learning and my adaptability to
						new technologies equip me to thrive in this dynamic
						field.
