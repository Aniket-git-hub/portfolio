				I am Aniket Singh, a recent graduate with a BBA degree,
				specializing in computer applications. My passion for coding has
				been a steadfast companion since my early years, beginning in
				class 9. Over the years, I've honed a comprehensive skill set in
				full-stack development, encompassing a range of technologies. On
				the front-end, I'm adept in React, JavaScript, and TypeScript,
				while on the back-end, I'm proficient in Node.js, Express,
				MongoDB, and SQL. This proficiency enables me to seamlessly
				bridge the gap between user interface and server-side
				functionality. I'm excited about the opportunity to leverage
				these skills to create innovative and efficient solutions for
				your team.
